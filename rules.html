      <p>The common interest that members of the Association share is to inspire 
        youth to practice the ideals of sportsmanship and fair play. Any player, coach, 
        team, parent, spectator, administrator or referee whose behavior detracts from 
        this purpose is subject to disciplinary action regardless of technical hockey 
        background, expertise, accomplishments or standing.</p>

      <ol class="ol-primer">
        <li>DIMENSIONS:

            <li>IHF Law 1 provides for flexible external field dimensions within 
              a given maximum and minimum width and length. These dimensions should be 
              adhered to for all fields used by teams under 12 and older.

          </ul>
        </li>

            <li>Fields used within the competition program must be 
              a minimum of 100 x 60 yards.Leagues, districts or associations participating in 
              the state competition program that are unable to provide a field that meets these 
              minimum requirements must advise the State Competition Board which will 
              assign its Fields Committee to inspect the field and recommend to the Board 
              whether or not a waiver of the minimum dimensions should be granted. Teams 
              from leagues, districts or associations that are unable to provide an acceptable 
              field may be required to play all their games away</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

              <li>U-6 play on a field approximately 20 X 40 yards with no penalty areas. Fields 
                for older age groups should be progressively larger.</li>
